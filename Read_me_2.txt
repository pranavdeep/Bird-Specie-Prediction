This project shall be succesfully completed only if the following pre-requisites are satisfied:

1) Succesful completion and execution of Project-1
---> Basic understanding of Decision Trees(Chapter-01) is required to understand Random Forests
---> If you did not understand Project-1, it is highly recommended to review it and come back

2) Decent insight of Linear Algebra - Especially matrices	(GOOD TO KNOW)

3) The understanding of these terms related to Machine Learning shall be very useful. Therefore, it is recommended to learn about these terms before continuing further:
	a) Random Forests  (MANDATORY TO UNDERSTAND)
	b) Confusion Matrix (MANDATORY TO UNDERSTAND)
	c) Classification techniques (GOOD TO KNOW)
	d) Linear & Logistic Regression intuition shall always be helpful to have a better understanding (GOOD TO KNOW)

Check if all the Read_me_1 instructions are throughly followed and installed as this code was executed in those mentioned environment. Any changes in the 
environment mentioned in Read_me_1 might need subsequent syntax changes.
